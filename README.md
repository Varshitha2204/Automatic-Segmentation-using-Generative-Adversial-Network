# Automatic-Segmentation-using-Generative-Adversial-Network
Automatic segmentation model which enhances the segmented images for further applications in forensic odontology. In contemporary dentistry, dental imaging is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. For a variety of dental applications, precise segmentation of individual teeth within panoramic dental images is essential. A more accurate and efficient method is required because manual segmentation is labor-intensive and prone to errors. In response, this study presents a novel approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for automating the creation of tooth masks. Our methodology is based on a GAN framework, which is made up of a Discriminator (D) and a Generator (G). The Discriminator separates genuine tooth masks from those produced by G, and the Generator is responsible for creating tooth masks from panoramic photos. The model can produce extremely accurate tooth masks, according to the results, which has important ramifications for the dentistry industry. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated visually through comparisons between generated and real masks. Improved dental imaging is made possible by this research, opening the door for uses like tooth anomaly detection. our approach offers an automated tooth mask generation system that makes use of GANs. The dental industry stands to gain greatly from this, as it provides a way to improve treatment planning and diagnosis. Although there are still issues with data variability and model scalability, this work lays the groundwork for further improvements and refinements.
